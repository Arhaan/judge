An online judge built with Python and the Django framework to test cases against your solution. A better version of this is to be implemented in DomeCode. Check out the sponsor links and help fund DomeCode.

I'm trying to build an online judge to allow users of DomeCode to practice coding problems online. DomeCode is a project of mine in the making that allows people to learn code by practicing,participating in DomeCode's forum and using the resources compiled from all over the internet and woven together to create a one-stop experience for programmers.

## Why?

To put it simply, adding a compiler like Cloud9 IDE or Sphere online judge is gonna cost me some bucks so initially I plan on building an in-house solution to allow users to practice coding problems like they did on Google Kickstart before 2019 or the way Coursera's autograder does. I hope this works out since the concept is sound as per my understanding.

## Support 

Since I've already started to build this, I'm probably gonna learn to build a cloud based compiler as well and add it on this existing version of Online Judge/autograder to make it a full-fledged Online Judge to the likes of Sphere Online Judge. 

I intend to keep the source code absolutely open source forever for people to use and instead of paying services like Cloud9 IDE or Sphere Online Judge, this would allow users to implement this in the form a PyPi package ( will ship it soon ) and use it for their own applications and host it on AWS/GCP/Digital Ocean for slightly cheaper than you might with a pre built online judge to be embedded in your application.

This open source project is here to stay and be maintained so I would urge you to consider supporting this project by sponsoring it! Links included on the Github repo info panel.
